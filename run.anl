Mako is a talented firebender from a multicultural family who grew up on the streets of Republic City as an orphan with his younger brother,  Bolin . In sharp contrast to his brother, Mako's personality can best be characterized as stoic and brooding. Living on the streets has given him a “rough-edge", though he relaxes somewhat when he's with his friends. Mako is also described as being outspoken, generally not afraid to share his opinions with others.  He’s also characterized as smart and a dedicated worker who at times puts his career before anything else. Additionally, Mako is very guarded in his dealings with strangers, lacking the naivety of his brother. For roughly 1/2 of the series' run, Mako wore a signature red scarf that was once his father San's, who was murdered along with his mother when he was eight years old.

P. van Lange, a  social psychologist  at the  Vrije Universiteit   Amsterdam  pointed out the similarity to the  Stanford Prison Experiment  (1971). In that experiment the participants were placed in a jail, where half played guards and the other half prisoners. In six days the experiment derailed. The guards became  aggressive ,  repressive  and  sadistic . They transformed into personalities outside their normal selves. "From the Stanford-experiment may be concluded that human behavior is largely summoned by the local circumstances", added his colleague J. van der Pligt, professor at the  Universiteit van Amsterdam ."People get carried away," said A. Bergsma of Psychologie Magazine. "Isolation becomes reality. They lose themselves in the experiment. There are no checks and balances. If there is no correction, they will derail one after another."  All experts agreed that the big reward for the winner increased the chance of accidents. But not all had a negative opinion. A. Lange, a professor of clinical psychology at the Universiteit van Amsterdam indicated that the program could produce certain insights not possible to achieve any more in socio-psychological research because the psychological well-being of the participant had been given greater importance. "The  design  of the programme is the  wet dream  of a psychological researcher. Nowhere in the world an ethical commission will be found that would agree to such a design", agreed psycho-physiologist A. Gaillard of the  Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research .

Richard Dawkins  has explained evolution as "a theory of gradual, incremental change over millions of years, which starts with something very simple and works up along slow, gradual gradients to greater complexity," and described the existing fossil record as entirely consistent with that process. Biologists emphasize that transitional gaps between those fossils recovered are to be expected, that the existence of any such gaps cannot be invoked to disprove evolution, and that instead the fossil evidence that could be used to disprove the theory would be those fossils which are found and which are entirely inconsistent with what can be predicted or anticipated by the evolutionary model. One example given by Dawkins was, "If there were a single  hippo  or  rabbit in the Precambrian , that would completely blow evolution out of the water. None have ever been found."
CAR_843bb7efa17bb16f74c313e72de6c646b80cbf67
Thus, transitional fossils like Archaeopteryx came to be seen as not only corroborating Darwin's theory, but as icons of evolution in their own right. For example, the Swedish  encyclopedic dictionary  Nordisk familjebok of 1904 showed an inaccurate Archaeopteryx reconstruction (see illustration) of the fossil, "ett af de betydelsefullaste paleontologiska fynd, som någonsin gjorts" ("one of the most significant paleontological discoveries ever made").

Jean Baptiste Lamarck  used fossils in his arguments for his theory of the transmutation of species in the early 19th century. Fossil finds, and the emerging evidence that life had changed over time, fueled speculation on this topic during the next few decades.  Robert Chambers  used fossil evidence in his 1844 popular science book  Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation , which advocated an evolutionary origin for the cosmos as well as for life on earth. Like Lamarck's theory it maintained that life had progressed from the simple to the complex. These early evolutionary ideas were widely discussed in scientific circles but were not accepted into the scientific mainstream. Many of the critics of transmutational ideas used fossil evidence in their arguments. In the same paper that coined the term dinosaur Richard Owen pointed out that dinosaurs were at least as sophisticated and complex as modern reptiles, which he claimed contradicted transmutational theories.  Hugh Miller  would make a similar argument, pointing out that the fossil fish found in the  Old Red Sandstone  formation were fully as complex as any later fish, and not the primitive forms alleged by Vestiges. While these early evolutionary theories failed to become accepted as mainstream science, the debates over them would help pave the way for the acceptance of Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection a few years later.

Other relationships can be more controversial. Scientists can use the relationships between fossils of different periods to support the theory of evolution. For example, a paleontologist might study the fossilized remains of prehistoric horses to determine how they relate to modern horses.

Chapter X examines whether patterns in the fossil record are better explained by common descent and branching evolution through natural selection, than by the individual creation of fixed species. Darwin expected species to change slowly, but not at  the same rate  – some organisms such as  Lingula  were unchanged since the earliest fossils. The pace of natural selection would depend on variability and change in the environment. This distanced his theory from  Lamarckian  laws of inevitable progress. It has been argued that this anticipated the  punctuated equilibrium  hypothesis, but other scholars have preferred to emphasise Darwin's commitment to gradualism. He cited  Richard Owen 's findings that the earliest members of a class were a few simple and generalised species with characteristics intermediate between modern forms, and were followed by increasingly diverse and specialised forms, matching the branching of common descent from an ancestor. Patterns of extinction matched his theory, with related groups of species having a continued existence until extinction, then not reappearing. Recently extinct species were more similar to living species than those from earlier eras, and as he had seen in South America, and  William Clift  had shown in Australia, fossils from recent geological periods resembled species still living in the same area.

Charles Darwin 's publication of the  On the Origin of Species  in 1859 was a watershed event in all the life sciences, especially paleontology. Fossils had played a role in the development of Darwin's theory. In particular he had been impressed by fossils he had collected in  South America  during the  voyage of the Beagle  of  giant armadillo s,  giant sloth s, and what at the time he thought were  giant llama s that seemed to be related to species still living on the continent in modern times. The scientific debate that started immediately after the publication of Origin led to a concerted effort to look for  transitional fossils  and other evidence of evolution in the fossil record. There were two areas where early success attracted considerable public attention, the transition between reptiles and birds, and the evolution of the modern single-toed horse. In 1861 the first specimen of  Archaeopteryx , an animal with both teeth and feathers and a mix of other reptilian and avian features, was discovered in a limestone quarry in Bavaria and described by  Richard Owen . Another would be found in the late 1870s and put on display at a Museum in Berlin in 1881. Other primitive toothed birds were found by  Othniel Marsh  in Kansas in 1872. Marsh also discovered fossils of several primitive horses in the Western United States that helped trace the  evolution of the horse  from the small 5-toed  Hyracotherium  of the  Eocene  to the much larger single-toed modern horses of the genus Equus.  Thomas Huxley  would make extensive use of both the horse and bird fossils in his advocacy of evolution. Acceptance of evolution occurred rapidly in scientific circles, but acceptance of Darwin's proposed mechanism of  natural selection  as the driving force behind it was much less universal. In particular some paleontologists such as  Edward Drinker Cope  and  Henry Fairfield Osborn  preferred alternatives such as neo- Lamarckism , the inheritance of characteristics acquired during life, and  orthogenesis , an innate drive to change in a particular direction, to explain what they perceived as linear trends in evolution.

In 1859, when  Charles Darwin 's  On the Origin of Species  was first published, the fossil record was poorly known. Darwin described the perceived lack of transitional fossils as, "...the most obvious and gravest objection which can be urged against my theory," but explained it by relating it to the extreme imperfection of the geological record. He noted the limited collections available at that time, but described the available information as showing patterns that followed from his theory of  descent with modification  through  natural selection . Indeed,  Archaeopteryx  was discovered just two years later, in 1861, and represents a classic transitional form between  dinosaur s and  bird s.  Many more transitional fossils  have been discovered since then, and there is now abundant evidence of how all  classes  of  vertebrate s are related, much of it in the form of transitional fossils. Specific examples include  humans and other primates ,  tetrapod s and  fish , and  birds and dinosaurs .

With Darwin's theory, a general acceptance that classification should reflect the Darwinian principle of  common descent  quickly appeared.  Tree of Life  representations became popular in scientific works, with known fossil groups incorporated. One of the first modern groups tied to fossil ancestors was  birds . Using the then newly discovered fossils of  Archaeopteryx  and  Hesperornis ,  Thomas Henry Huxley  pronounced that they had evolved from dinosaurs, a group formally named by  Richard Owen  in 1842. The resulting description, that of dinosaurs "giving rise to" or being "the ancestors of" birds, is the essential hallmark of  evolutionary taxonomic  thinking. As more and more fossil groups were found and recognized in the late 19th and early 20th centuries,  palaeontologists  worked to understand the history of animals through the ages by linking together known groups. With the  modern evolutionary synthesis  of the early 1940s, an essentially modern understanding of the evolution of the major groups was in place. As evolutionary taxonomy is based on Linnaean taxonomic ranks, the two terms are largely interchangeable in modern use.

Chapter IX deals with the fact that the  geologic record  appears to show forms of life suddenly arising, without the innumerable  transitional fossil s expected from gradual changes. Darwin borrowed  Charles Lyell 's argument in  Principles of Geology  that the record is extremely imperfect as  fossil isation is a very rare occurrence, spread over vast periods of time; since few areas had been geologically explored, there could only be fragmentary knowledge of  geological formations , and fossil collections were very poor. Evolved local varieties which migrated into a wider area would seem to be the sudden appearance of a new species. Darwin did not expect to be able to reconstruct evolutionary history, but continuing discoveries gave him well founded hope that new finds would occasionally reveal transitional forms. To show that there had been enough time for natural selection to work slowly, he again cited Principles of Geology and other observations based on sedimentation and erosion, including an estimate that erosion of  The Weald  had taken 300 million years. The initial appearance of entire groups of well developed organisms in the oldest fossil-bearing layers, now known as the  Cambrian explosion , posed a problem. Darwin had no doubt that earlier seas had swarmed with living creatures, but stated that he had no satisfactory explanation for the lack of fossils. Fossil evidence of  pre-Cambrian  life has since been found, extending the history of life back for billions of years.

Burger's first study had results similar to the ones found in Milgram's previous study. The rates of obedience were very similar to those found in the Milgram study, showing that participants' tendency to obey has not declined over time. Additionally, Burger found that both genders exhibited similar behavior, suggesting that obedience will occur in participants independent of gender.In Burger's follow-up study, he found that participants that worried about the well being of the learner were more hesitant to continue the study. He also found that the more the experimenter prodded the participant to continue, the more likely they were to stop the experiment.The Utrecht University study also replicated Milgram's results. They found that although participants indicated they did not enjoy the task, over 90% of them completed the experiment.The Bocchiaro and Zimbardo study had similar levels of obedience compared to the Milgram and Utrecht studies. They also found that participants would either stop the experiment at the first sign of the learner's pleas or would continue until the end of the experiment (called "the foot in the door scenario").In addition to the above studies, additional research using participants from different cultures (including Spain, Australia, and Jordan) also found participants to be obedient.

The other classical study on obedience was conducted at  Stanford University  during the 1970s.  Phillip Zimbardo  was the main psychologist responsible for the experiment. In the  Stanford Prison Experiment , college age students were put into a pseudo prison environment in order to study the impacts of "social forces" on participants behavior. Unlike the Milgram study in which each participant underwent the same experimental conditions, here using  random assignment  half the participants were prison guards and the other half were prisoners. The experimental setting was made to physically resemble a prison while simultaneously inducing "a psychological state of imprisonment".

Charles Sheridan and Richard King (at the  University of Missouri  and the  University of California, Berkeley , respectively) hypothesized that some of Milgram's subjects may have suspected that the victim was faking, so they repeated the experiment with a real victim: a "cute, fluffy puppy" who was given real, albeit apparently harmless, electric shocks. Their findings were dissimilar to those of Milgram: half of the male subjects and all of the females obeyed throughout. Many subjects showed high levels of distress during the experiment, and some openly wept. In addition, Sheridan and King found that the duration for which the shock button was pressed decreased as the shocks got higher, meaning that for higher shock levels, subjects were more hesitant.

Zimbardo reflects on the dramatic visual similarities between the behaviour of the participants in the  Stanford prison experiment , and the  prisoner abuse at Abu Ghraib . He did not accept the  Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff   General Myers ' claim that the events were due to a few rogue soldiers and that it did not reflect on the military. Instead he looked at the situation the soldiers were in and considered the possibility that this situation might have induced the behaviour that they displayed. He began with the assumption that were probably "good apples" in a situation like that of the Stanford prison experiment, where he knew that physically and psychologically normal and healthy people were behaving sadistically and brutalising prisoners.

The Milgram study found that participants would obey orders even when it posed severe harm to others. This result was surprising to Milgram because he thought that "subjects have learned from childhood that it is a fundamental breach of moral conduct to hurt another person against his will".Zimbardo found similar results as the guards in the study obeyed orders so much that their behavior turned aggressive. Prisoners likewise were hostile to and resented their guards, and because of the psychological duress induced in the experiment, it had to be shut down after only 6 days.

Both the Milgram and Stanford experiments were conducted in experimental circumstances. In 1966, psychiatrist Charles K. Hofling published the results of a  field experiment  on obedience in the nurse–physician relationship in its natural hospital setting. Nurses, unaware they were taking part in an experiment, were ordered by unknown doctors to administer dangerous doses of a (fictional) drug to their patients. Although several hospital rules disallowed administering the drug under the circumstances, 21 out of the 22 nurses would have given the patient an overdose of medicine.

The previous two studies greatly influenced how modern psychologists think about obedience. Milgram's study in particular generated a large response from the psychology community. In a modern study, Jerry Burger replicated Milgram's method with a few alterations. Burger's method was identical to Milgram's except when the shocks reached 150 volts, participants decided whether or not they wanted to continue and then the experiment ended (base condition). To ensure the safety of the participants, Burger added a two-step screening process; this was to rule out any participants that may react negatively to the experiment. In the modeled refusal condition, two confederates were used, where one confederate acted as the learner and the other was the teacher. The teacher stopped after going up to 90 volts, and the participant was asked to continue where the confederate left off.  This methodology was considered more ethical because many of the adverse psychological effects seen in previous studies' participants occurred after moving past 150 volts. Additionally, since Milgram's study only used men, Burger tried to determine if there were differences between genders in his study and randomly assigned equal numbers of men and women to the experimental conditions.

The growing complexity and specialization of the Late Bronze Age political, economic, and social organization in Carol Thomas and Craig Conant's phrase together made the organization of civilization too intricate to reestablish piecewise when disrupted. That could explain why the collapse was so widespread and able to render the Bronze Age civilizations incapable of recovery. The critical flaws of the Late Bronze Age are its centralisation, specialisation, complexity, and top-heavy political structure. These flaws then were exposed by sociopolitical events (revolt of peasantry and defection of mercenaries), fragility of all kingdoms (Mycenaean, Hittite, Ugaritic, and Egyptian), demographic crises (overpopulation), and wars between states. Other factors that could have placed increasing pressure on the fragile kingdoms include interruption of maritime trade by piracy by the  Sea Peoples , as well as drought, crop failure, famine, or the Dorian migration or invasion.

Periodic breakdowns in the cultural system have occurred for a number of reasons. The demands for labor has from time to time led to population increases that push the limits of the ecological carrying capacity, and should a period of climatic instability ensue, collapsing central government and declining populations can occur. Alternatively, military vulnerability to invasion from marginal hill tribes or nomadic pastoralists has led to periods of trade collapse and neglect of irrigation systems. Equally, centripetal tendencies amongst city states has meant that central authority over the whole region, when imposed, has tended to be ephemeral, and localism has fragmented power into tribal or smaller regional units. These trends have continued to the present day in Iraq.

With the amplitude of trade, Islam was adopted throughout the empire. However, the king continued to follow his cultural beliefs. Twelve mosques were built, and Islamic schools. Some Arab historians relate the decline of the Empire to the attack of  Almoravid  who came to convert the empire into Islam, but others believe the power of Islam was slow and did not engage any assault. There are many explanations about what led to the decline of the empire. One fact is that the king lost his trading monopoly. Also, drought began to have a long-term effect on the land, ruining its ability to sustain cattle and cultivation. New gold fields began mining, for example, at Bure (modern  Guinea ) which was out of reach for Ghana and new trade routes were opening up further east and across the Atlantic.

many scholars believe that drought and a decline in trade with Egypt and Mesopotamia caused the collapse of the Indus Civilisation. Recent examination of human skeletons from the site of Harappa has demonstrated that the end of the Indus civilisation saw an increase in inter-personal violence and in infectious diseases such as leprosy and tuberculosis. Other suggested contributory causes for the collapse of the IVC include immigration by new peoples, deforestation, floods, and changes in the course of the river.  The  Cemetery H culture  was the manifestation of the Late Harappan over a large area in the south, and the  Ochre Coloured Pottery culture  its successor.

The gradual breakdown and transformation of economic and social linkages and infrastructure resulted in increasingly localized outlooks. This breakdown was often fast and dramatic as it became unsafe to travel or carry goods over any distance; there was a consequent collapse in trade and manufacture for export. Major industries that depended on trade, such as large-scale pottery manufacture, vanished almost overnight in places like Britain.  Tintagel  in  Cornwall , as well as several other centers, managed to obtain supplies of Mediterranean luxury goods well into the 6th century, but then lost their trading links. Administrative, educational and military infrastructure quickly vanished, and the loss of the established  cursus honorum  led to the collapse of the schools and to a rise of illiteracy even among the leadership. The careers of  Cassiodorus  (died c. 585) at the beginning of this period and of  Alcuin of York  (died 804) at its close were founded alike on their valued literacy. For the formerly Roman area, there was another 20 percent decline in population between 400 and 600, or a one-third decline for 150-600. In the 8th century, the volume of trade reached its lowest level. The very small number of  shipwreck s found that dated from the 8th century supports this (which represents less than 2 percent of the number of shipwrecks dated from the 1st century). There were also reforestation and a retreat of agriculture that centered around 500.

Bronze Age collapse theories have described aspects of the end of the Age in this region. At the end of the Bronze Age in the Aegean region, the  Mycenaean  administration of the regional trade empire followed the decline of Minoan primacy. Several Minoan  client states  lost much of their population to famine and/or pestilence. This would indicate that the trade network may have failed, preventing the trade that would previously have relieved such famines and prevented illness caused by malnutrition. It is also known that in this era the  breadbasket  of the Minoan empire, the area north of the  Black Sea , also suddenly lost much of its population, and thus probably some capacity to cultivate crops.

The  Bronze Age collapse  is the transition from the  Late Bronze Age  to the  Early Iron Age , expressed by the collapse of  palace economies  of the  Aegean  and  Anatolia , which were replaced after a hiatus by the isolated village cultures of the  Dark Age period in history  of the ancient Near East. Some have gone so far as to call the catalyst that ended the Bronze Age a "catastrophe". The Bronze Age collapse may be seen in the context of a technological history that saw the slow, comparatively continuous spread of iron-working technology in the region, beginning with precocious iron-working in what is now  Romania  in the 13th and 12th centuries. The cultural collapse of the  Mycenaean kingdoms , the  Hittite Empire  in  Anatolia  and  Syria , and the  Egyptian Empire  in  Syria  and  Israel , the scission of long-distance  trade  contacts and sudden eclipse of literacy occurred between 1206 and 1150 BCE. In the first phase of this period, almost every city between  Troy  and  Gaza  was violently destroyed, and often left unoccupied thereafter (for example,  Hattusas ,  Mycenae ,  Ugarit ).

The end of the Ottomány culture is connected with turbulent events at the end of Old Bronze Age in Central Europe, where there was a collapse of the whole "Old Bronze Age world" with its highly advanced culture of mighty hill-forts, rich burials, and trade over wast distances. The gradual decline in the number of fortified settlements, change of burial rites, and the decision of people to desert fortified settlements could have had several reasons, including the collapse of trade and exchange networks, the attacks of enemies, the internal collapse of society or environmental causes. The following Middle Bronze Age/Late Bronze Age cultures are very different in their burial rites (cremation, erecting of barrows) as well as in their handling of bronze - there is an "explosion" in bronze working, and many bronze hoards found across all of Europe illustrate this change in quantity and quality of produced bronze objects. We see not only bronze ornaments and arms (including first examples of  sword s), but also bronze tools ( sickle s,  axe s,  adze s), which changed the everyday life of prehistoric man.

The subjects were not only asked to answer whether or not they would participate, but they were also asked to estimate other people's responses, and make inferences about the disposition of each group of people based on their agreement and disagreement to participate. Overall, the experimenters found that "those who agreed to participate thought that an average of 62% of their peers would agree"; but, those who disagreed with participating thought that an average 33% of their peers would agree to the job". Furthermore, those who agreed had more extreme inferences about the personal dispositions of those who disagreed, and vice versa. The results indicated that the subjects failed to recognize that their peer's construal or interpretation of the situation may be quite different from the perspective they personally take.

Now a more widely recognized study since the publication of his book, The Lucifer Effect, the  Stanford Prison Experiment  is infamous for its blatant display of  aggression  in deindividuated situations. Zimbardo created a mock prison environment in the basement of  Stanford University ’s psychology building in which he  randomly assigned  24 men to undertake the role of either guard or prisoner. These men were specifically chosen because they had no abnormal personality traits (e.g.:  narcissistic ,  authoritarian ,  antisocial , etc.) The experiment, originally planned to span over two weeks, ended after only six days because of the sadistic treatment of the prisoners by the guards. Zimbardo attributed this behavior to deindividuation due to immersion within the group and creation of a strong  group dynamic . Several elements added to the deindividuation of both guards and prisoners. Prisoners were made to dress alike, wearing stocking caps and hospital dressing gowns, and also were identified only by a number assigned to them rather than by their name. Guards were also given uniforms and reflective glasses which hid their faces. The dress of guards and prisoners led to a type of  anonymity  on both sides because the individual identifying characteristics of the men were taken out of the equation. Additionally, the guards had the added element of  diffusion of responsibility  which gave them the opportunity to remove personal responsibility and place it on a higher power. Several guards commented that they all believed that someone else would have stopped them if they were truly crossing the line, so they continued with their behavior. Zimbardo's prison study would have not been stopped if one of Zimbardo's graduate students, Christina Maslach, had not pointed it out to him.

Stanford University  psychology professor  Philip Zimbardo  conducts a  psychological experiment  to test the hypothesis that the personality traits of prisoners and guards are the chief cause of abusive behavior between them. In the experiment, Zimbardo selects fifteen male students to participate in a 14-day prison simulation to take roles as prisoners or guards. They receive $15 per day. The experiment is conducted in a mock prison located in the basement of Jordan Hall, the university's psychology department building. The students who are guards become abusive, as does Zimbardo himself. Two students who play the role of prisoners quit the experiment early, and Zimbardo abruptly stops the entire experiment after only six days.

The findings of the study were very different from those of the  Stanford Prison Experiment . Specifically, (a) there was no evidence of guards conforming "naturally" to the role, and (b) in response to manipulations that served to increase a sense of shared identity amongst the prisoners, over time, they demonstrated increased resistance to the guards' regime. This culminated in a prison breakout on Day 6 of the study that made the regime unworkable. After this, the participants created a "self-governing commune" but this too collapsed due to internal tensions created by those who had organized the earlier breakout. After this, a group of former prisoners and guards conspired to install a new prisoner-guard regime in which they would be the "new guards". Now, however, they wanted to run the system along much harsher lines – akin to those seen in the Stanford study. Signs that this would compromise the well-being of participants led to early termination of the study.

The Stanford Prison Experiment (SPE) was a study of the  psychological  effects of perceived power. Specifically, the study focused on the power struggle between  prisoner s and  prison guard s. The experiment was conducted at  Stanford University  on August 14–20, 1971, by a team of researchers led by psychology professor  Philip Zimbardo  using college students. It was funded by the  U.S. Office of Naval Research  and was of interest to both the  U.S. Navy  and  Marine Corps  as an investigation into the causes of conflict between military guards and prisoners.  The experiment is a topic covered in most introductory psychology textbooks.

Since microevolution is small-scale (âmicroâ) biological change, and macroevolution is large-scale (âmacroâ) biological change, many Darwinists argue that macroevolution is simply the accumulation of microevolutionary changes over time. Ostensibly, this is a reasonable extrapolation of microevolution.

Microevolution can be contrasted with macroevolution, which is the occurrence of large-scale changes in gene frequencies in a population over a geological time period (i.e. consisting of either rapid or extended microevolution). The difference is largely one of approach.

These outcomes of evolution are distinguished based on time scale as  macroevolution  versus microevolution. Macroevolution refers to evolution that occurs at or above the level of species, in particular speciation and extinction; whereas microevolution refers to smaller evolutionary changes within a species or population, in particular shifts in  gene frequency  and adaptation. In general, macroevolution is regarded as the outcome of long periods of microevolution. Thus, the distinction between micro- and macroevolution is not a fundamental one—the difference is simply the time involved. However, in macroevolution, the traits of the entire species may be important. For instance, a large amount of variation among individuals allows a species to rapidly adapt to new  habitat s, lessening the chance of it going extinct, while a wide geographic range increases the chance of speciation, by making it more likely that part of the population will become isolated. In this sense, microevolution and macroevolution might involve selection at different levels—with microevolution acting on genes and organisms, versus macroevolutionary processes such as  species selection  acting on entire species and affecting their rates of speciation and extinction.

Scientific organizations such as the  American Association for the Advancement of Science  describe microevolution as small scale change within species, and macroevolution as the formation of new species, but otherwise not being different from microevolution. In macroevolution, an accumulation of microevolutionary changes leads to speciation. The main difference between the two processes is that one occurs within a few generations, whilst the other takes place over thousands of years (i.e. a quantitative difference). Essentially they describe the same process; although evolution beyond the species level results in beginning and ending generations which could not interbreed, the intermediate generations could.

Overview. Red blood cells are important for the transport of oxygen-rich blood to body tissues and removal of carbon dioxide from the body. Red blood cells are red because they contain an iron-rich protein known as hemoglobin, which is bright red in color. Over time, red blood cells wear out and die.The bone marrow continually makes more red blood cells. Certain foods increase production of red blood cells.olic Acid-Rich Foods. Folic acid, also known as vitamin B9, is a B-complex vitamin that helps the body make new healthy red blood cells. Patients with low levels of folic acid often develop anemia. Patients can increase red blood cells in the body by consuming foods rich in folic acid.

The main theme of the story is a clash between two views of the world, one very logical, pragmatic, physical, and the other one romantic and spiritual. It shows that not all mysteries need to be uncovered, not all secrets revealed, that unknown is not always bad, that it keeps people searching, asking questions, coming back. What is known for certain, is often taken for granted and then loses attraction.

"The main theme of the film is to surround yourself with people who truly have your best interest at heart," she said. "I think you can get caught up in whatever you do, it doesn’t have to be the entertainment industry, it can be the workforce or whatever. You can surround yourself with people who are not necessarily looking out for you from a godly perspective, but want you to make money, or are using you for a certain thing, or have a certain motive that isn’t pure. It's really about surrounding yourself with fellow Christians and putting God first–I think that is the biggest part of this story."

A further criticism directed at functionalism is that it contains no sense of  agency , that individuals are seen as puppets, acting as their role requires. Yet Holmwood states that the most sophisticated forms of functionalism are based on "a highly developed concept of action" [2005:107], and as was explained above, Parsons took as his starting point the individual and their actions. His theory did not however articulate how these actors exercise their agency in opposition to the socialization and inculcation of accepted norms. As has been shown above, Merton addressed this limitation through his concept of deviance, and so it can be seen that functionalism allows for agency. It cannot, however, explain why individuals choose to accept or reject the accepted norms, why and in what circumstances they choose to exercise their agency, and this does remain a considerable limitation of the theory.

Functionalism , in regard to religious studies, is the analysis of religions and their various communities of adherents using the functions of particular religious phenomena to interpret the structure of religious communities and their beliefs. The approach was introduced by British anthropologist  Alfred Radcliffe-Brown . A major criticism of functionalism is that it lends itself to  teleological  explanations.  An example of a functionalist approach is understanding the dietary restrictions contained in the  Pentateuch  as having the function of promoting health or providing social identity (i.e. a sense of belonging though common practice).
CAR_f304f1377652bef02572e36aa6e3f005fcc7c291
Further criticisms have been levelled at functionalism by proponents of other social theories, particularly  conflict theorists ,  Marxists ,  feminists  and  postmodernists . Conflict theorists criticized functionalism's concept of systems as giving far too much weight to integration and consensus, and neglecting independence and conflict [Holmwood, 2005:100]. Lockwood [in Holmwood, 2005:101], in line with conflict theory, suggested that Parsons' theory missed the concept of system contradiction. He did not account for those parts of the system that might have tendencies to Mal-integration. According to Lockwood, it was these tendencies that come to the surface as opposition and conflict among actors. However Parsons thought that the issues of conflict and cooperation were very much intertwined and sought to account for both in his model [Holmwood, 2005:103]. In this however he was limited by his analysis of an ‘ideal type' of society which was characterized by consensus. Merton, through his critique of functional unity, introduced into functionalism an explicit analysis of tension and conflict. Yet Merton's functionalist explanations of social phenomena continued to rest on the idea that society is primarily co-operative rather than conflicted, which differentiates Merton from conflict theorists.
CAR_34a7908b93aff0abc09b19cb1a1947bb22abef5a
Another common criticism of functionalism is that it implies a radical form of  semantic holism . Block and Fodor referred to this as the damn/darn problem. The difference between saying "damn" or "darn" when one smashes one's finger with a hammer can be mentally significant. But since these outputs are, according to functionalism, related to many (if not all) internal mental states, two people who experience the same pain and react with different outputs must share little (perhaps nothing) in common in any of their mental states. But this is counter-intuitive; it seems clear that two people share something significant in their mental states of being in pain if they both smash their finger with a hammer, whether or not they utter the same word when they cry out in pain.

One of the main arguments against functionalism was formulated by Putnam himself: the  Twin Earth thought experiment . However, there have been other criticisms. The  Chinese room  argument by  John Searle  (1980) is a direct attack on the claim that thought can be represented as a set of functions. The thought experiment is designed to show that it is possible to mimic intelligent action, without any interpretation or understanding, through the use of a purely functional system. In short, Searle describes a situation in which a person who speaks only English is locked in a room with Chinese symbols in baskets and a rule book in English for moving the symbols around. The person is instructed, by people outside the room, to follow the rule book for sending certain symbols out of the room when given certain symbols. Further, suppose that the people outside the room are Chinese speakers and are communicating with the person inside via the Chinese symbols. According to Searle, it would be absurd to claim that the English speaker inside "knows" Chinese based on these syntactic processes alone. This thought experiment attempts to show that systems that operate merely on syntactic processes cannot realize any  semantics  (meaning) or  intentionality  (aboutness). Thus, Searle attacks the idea that thought can be equated with the following of a set of syntactic rules. Thus, functionalism is an inadequate theory of the mind. Several other arguments against functionalism have been advanced by  Ned Block .

The functional theory of  David Mitrany  is the oldest institutional theory of IR. Mitrany suggested that slim "functional agencies" should organize the needs of cooperation among even conflicting states. The  neofunctionalism  and the communitarian method of  Jean Monnet  advocated the principle of  supranationality : international bodies superordinated to the nation states should administer the common interests. The functionalist approaches have been often criticized to be idealistic and normative in their positive view on  international institutions .
CAR_fb361cd00aa26d30f7a30f6e184bb2ba66a759f7
Stronger criticisms include the  epistemological  argument that functionalism is  tautologous , that is it attempts to account for the development of social institutions solely through recourse to the effects that are attributed to them and thereby explains the two circularly. However, Parsons drew directly on many of Durkheim's concepts in creating his theory. Certainly Durkheim was one of the first theorists to explain a phenomenon with reference to the function it served for society. He said, "the determination of function is…necessary for the complete explanation of the phenomena" [cited in Coser, 1977:140]. However Durkheim made a clear distinction between historical and functional analysis, saying, "When ... the explanation of a social phenomenon is undertaken, we must seek separately the efficient cause which produces it and the function it fulfills" [cited in Coser, 1977:140]. If Durkheim made this distinction, then it is unlikely that Parsons did not. However Merton does explicitly state that functional analysis does not seek to explain why the action happened in the first instance, but why it continues or is reproduced. By this particular logic, it can be argued that functionalists do not necessarily explain the original cause of a phenomenon with reference to its effect. Yet the logic stated in reverse, that social phenomena are (re)produced because they serve ends, is unoriginal to functionalist thought. Thus functionalism is either undefinable or it can be defined by the teleological arguments which functionalist theorists normatively produced before Merton.

Native Americans in the Southwest and Mexico kept turkeys for feathers and food, and the birds, with their alarm calls, probably were good watch dogs as well. The Indians used the feathers in ceremonies, and they twisted and plaited the feathers with twine to form blankets.

Ben Franklin was not in favor of having the Bald Eagle as the national symbol, and would have opted for the wild turkey. As a naturalist, Ben Franklin realized that bald eagles were prone to scavengers and piracy. Eagles steal the spoils of its lesser cousin the Osprey.

A  cold gas thruster  typically stores  inert gas , such as  nitrogen , in a  pressurized tank  and releases the gas through a  nozzle  to produce thrust. Operation is handled by just a single  valve  in most systems, which makes cold gas the simplest useful propulsion technology. Cold gas propulsion systems can be very safe since the gases used do not have to be volatile or  corrosive , though some systems opt to feature dangerous gases such as  sulfur dioxide . This ability to use inert gases is highly advantageous to CubeSats as they are usually restricted from hazardous materials. Unfortunately, only low performance can be achieved with them, preventing high impulse maneuvers even in low mass CubeSats. Due to this low performance, their use in CubeSats for main propulsion is limited and designers choose higher efficiency systems with only minor increases in complexity. Cold gas systems more often see use in CubeSat attitude control.

CubeSat  electric propulsion  typically uses electric energy to accelerate propellant to high speed, which results in high  specific impulse . Many of these technologies can be made small enough for use in nanosatellites, and several methods are in development. Types of electric propulsion currently being designed for use in CubeSats include  Hall-effect thruster s,  ion thruster s,  pulsed plasma thruster s,  electrospray thrusters , and  resistojets . Several notable CubeSat missions plan to use electric propulsion, such as NASA's  Lunar IceCube . The high efficiency associated with electric propulsion could allow CubeSats to propel themselves to Mars. Electric propulsion systems are disadvantaged in their use of power, which requires the CubeSat to have larger solar cells, more complicated power distribution, and often larger batteries. Furthermore, many electric propulsion methods may still require pressurized tanks to store propellant, which is restricted by the CubeSat Design Specification.

CubeSat propulsion has made rapid advancements in the following technologies:  cold gas ,  chemical propulsion ,  electric propulsion , and  solar sail s. The biggest challenge with CubeSat propulsion is preventing risk to the launch vehicle and its primary  payload  while still providing significant capability. Components and methods that are commonly used in larger satellites are disallowed or limited and the CubeSat Design Specification (CDS) requires a waiver for pressurization above 1.2 standard  atmospheres , over 100 Wh of stored chemical energy, and hazardous materials. Those restrictions pose great challenges for CubeSat propulsion systems, as typical space propulsion systems utilize combinations of high pressures, high energy densities, and hazardous materials. Beyond the restrictions set forth by  launch service provider s, various technical challenges further reduce the usefulness of CubeSat propulsion.  Gimbaled thrust  cannot be used in small engines due to the complexity of gimbaling mechanisms, thrust vectoring must instead be achieved by thrusting asymmetrically in multiple-nozzle propulsion systems or by changing the center of mass relative to the CubeSat's geometry with actuated components. Small motors may also not have room for  throttling  methods that allow smaller than fully-on thrust, which is important for precision maneuvers such as  rendezvous . CubeSats which require longer life also benefit from propulsion systems, when used for  orbit keeping  a propulsion system can slow  orbital decay .

Moreover, the use of several toroid-shaped stages results in an increased stand-off distance to the sonic line during  atmospheric entry , reducing the possibility of damaging the stages because of the high temperatures reached. Another possible advantage is the capability to launch satellites with no need of folding them, as a flat-shaped vehicle is capable of fitting panel-deployed satellites right from the launch site.
