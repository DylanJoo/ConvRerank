Aside from difficulties in storing and accessing the paperwork (the floor of the incident room was reinforced to cope with the weight of the paper), it was difficult for officers to overcome the information overload of such a large manual system. Sutcliffe was interviewed nine times, but all information the police had about the case was stored in paper form, making cross-referencing difficult, compounded by television appeals for information which generated thousands more documents.", "neg_passage": "EDI and other similar technologies save a company money by providing an alternative to, or replacing, information flows that require a great deal of human interaction and paper documents. Even when paper documents are maintained in parallel with EDI exchange, e.g. printed shipping manifests, electronic exchange and the use of data from that exchange reduces the handling costs of sorting, distributing, organizing, and searching paper documents. EDI and similar technologies allow a company to take advantage of the benefits of storing and manipulating data electronically without the cost of manual entry. Another advantage of EDI is the opportunity to reduce or eliminate manual data entry errors, such as shipping and billing errors, because EDI eliminates the need to rekey documents on the destination side. One very important advantage of EDI over paper documents is the speed in which the trading partner receives and incorporates the information into their system thus greatly reducing cycle times. For this reason, EDI can be an important component of just-in-time production systems."}

Archaeus has recruited Drusilla to sire the students and wants Mary sired for a special reason. Faith, Fred and Koh save Mary while dusting the vampire students, though Drusilla escapes. Faith and Fred decide to wait for Angel to return to figure out their next move, while Mary visits her father who is researching an ancient statue. Angel's return causes Drusilla's vampires to wreak havoc on Magic Town while they capture Nadira.

During the first half of the nineteenth century,  some of the first systematic studies of organic compounds were reported. Around 1816  Michel Chevreul  started a study of  soap s made from various  fat s and  alkali s. He separated the different acids that, in combination with the alkali, produced the soap.  Since these were all individual compounds, he demonstrated that it was possible to make a chemical change in various fats (which traditionally come from  organic sources), producing new compounds, without \"vital force\". In 1828  Friedrich W\u00f6hler  produced the organic chemical  urea  (carbamide), a constituent of  urine , from the inorganic  ammonium cyanate  NHCNO, in what is now called the  W\u00f6hler synthesis .

The claim was repeated in 1986, when historian  David Baldwin  suggested that the remains were still in the Greyfriars area. He speculated, \"It is possible (though now perhaps unlikely) that at some time in the twenty-first century an excavator may yet reveal the slight remains of this famous monarch.\" In 2004 and 2005, John Ashdown-Hill tracked down two 17th-generation  matrilineal  descendants of Richard III's sister  Anne of York .

To reconstruct a chronology of the expansion by Alexander I's predecessors is more difficult, but generally, three stages have been proposed from Thucydides' reading.

The second stage consolidated rule in Pieria and Bottiaea, captured  Methone  and  Pella , and extended rule over  Eordaea  and  Almopia . According to Hammond, the third stage occurred after 550 BC, when the Macedonians gained control over  Mygdonia ,  Edonis , lower Paeonia,  Bisaltia  and  Crestonia . However, the second stage might have occurred as late as 520 BC; and the third stage probably did not occur until after 479 BC, when the Macedonians capitalized on the weakened Paeonian state after the  Achaemenid Empire  withdrawal from Macedon and the rest of their mainland European territories. Whatever the case, Thucydides' account of the Macedonian state describes its accumulated territorial extent by the rule of  Perdiccas II , Alexander I's son. Hammond has said that the early stages of Macedonian expansion were militaristic, subduing or expunging populations from a large and varied area. It has been hypothesized that the cause of Macedonian expansion was demographic pressure.

His first name, Gr\u00edmr, is Norse, but his last, Kamban, suggests a Gaelic origin (Camb\u00e1n). He may have been of mixed Norse and Irish origin and have come from a settlement in the  British Isles : a so-called  Norse-Gael . The Norse-Gaels had intermarried with speakers of  Irish , a language also spoken at the time in Scotland (being the ancestor of  Scottish Gaelic ). Evidence of a mixed cultural background in later settlers may be found in the Norse-Irish ring pins found in the Faroe Islands, and in features of Faroese vocabulary. Examples of such words (derived from Middle Irish) are: \"blak/bla\u00f0ak\" ( buttermilk ),  Irish  bl\u00e1thach; \"drunnur\" (animal tail),  Irish  dronn (chine);  \"gr\u00fakur\" ( head ),  Irish  gruaig (hair); \"l\u00e1mur\" (hand, paw),  Irish  l\u00e1mh (hand); \"tarvur\" ( bull ),  Irish  tarbh; and \"\u00e6rgi\" ( pasture  in the outfield),  Irish  \u00e1irge (byre, milking place: Mod. Irish \u00e1ir\u00ed). The discovery at Toftanes on Eysteroy of wooden devotional crosses apparently modelled on Irish or Scottish exemplars would indicate that some of the settlers were Christian. It has also been suggested that the typical curvilinear stone-built walls enclosing early ecclesiastical sites in the Faroes (as in Norse settlements elsewhere) reflect a Celtic Christian style, seen in the circular enclosures of early ecclesiastical sites in Ireland. Indirect support for this theory has been found in genetic research showing that many Norse settler women in the Faroe Islands had Celtic forebears.", "neg_passage": "Classical Gaelic (;  Irish : Gaeilge Chlasaiceach) was the shared literary form that was in use in Scotland and  Ireland  from the 13th to the 18th centuries.

Although the first written signs of  Scottish Gaelic  having diverged from Irish appear as far back as the 12th century annotations of the  Book of Deer , Scottish Gaelic did not have a standardised form and did not appear in print on a significant scale until the 1767 translation of the  New Testament  into Scottish Gaelic\u2014though  John Carswell 's Foirm na n-Urrnuidheadh, an adaptation of  John Knox 's  Book of Common Order , was the first book printed in either Scottish or Irish Gaelic."}

It is revealed in this game that Drake's past is more mysterious than the player is led to believe. It eventually transpires that Drake is not his real last name (his real last name, Morgan, is not revealed until Uncharted 4) and he was raised in a Catholic orphanage from the age of five. His mother committed suicide and his father handed the child over to the state. He ran away from the orphanage and traveled to Colombia, where, at the age of 15, he acquired Francis Drake's ring (which he has referred to as a family heirloom in the first game) by stealing it from a museum. This led to him teaming up with Victor Sullivan for the first time. With the assistance of Sully, Chloe, and Charlie Cutter, Nate steals valuable historical clues from a mysterious organization led by Katherine Marlowe and her assistant Talbot. They travel to France and Syria where they find clues leading them to Yemen, where Drake reluctantly enlists the help of Elena. They find a celestial map that shows the location of Iram. However, Sully is kidnapped by Marlowe and Talbot, prompting Drake to save him by boarding one of Marlowe's cargo planes. The plane crashes in the Rub' al Khali after a shoot-out ensues but Drake survives. After wandering the desert for days, a group of horsemen, led by Salim, rescue Drake and take him back to their encampment. Salim explains to Drake they must stop Marlowe and Talbot from reaching the lost city so they will not get their hands on the hallucinogenic power of the Djinn. Drake and Salim rescue Sully from Marlowe's caravan and reach the city. Drake and Sully destroy the winch pulling the brass vessel containing the Djinn from the waters causing the whole city to collapse.

He claimed that if participants could encode the grammar rules as productive memory sets, then they should be able to verbalize their strategy in detail. He conducted research that led to the development of the modern AGL paradigm. This research used a synthetic grammar learning model to test implicit learning. AGL became the most used and tested model in the field. As in the original paradigm developed by Miller, participants were asked to memorize a list of letter strings which were created from an artificial grammar rule model. It was only during the test phase that participants were told that there was a set of rules behind the letter sequences they memorized. They were then instructed to categorize new letter strings based on the same set of rules which they had not previously been exposed to. They classified new letter strings as \"grammatical\" (constructed from the grammar rule), vs. \"randomly constructed\" sequences. If subjects correctly sorted the new strings above chance level, it could be inferred that subjects had acquired the grammatical rule structure without any explicit instruction of the rules. Reber found that participants sorted out new strings above chance level. While they reported using strategies during the sorting task, they could not actually verbalize those strategies. Subjects could identify which strings were grammatically correct but could not identify the rules that composed grammatical strings."}

Scholars note the influence of  Leonardo da Vinci 's \" sfumato \" (smoky) technique on his work, for example in his Venus and Amor and Lais of Corinth. From the Italians, Holbein learned the art of single-point  perspective  and the use of antique motifs and architectural forms. In this, he may have been influenced by  Andrea Mantegna . The decorative detail recedes in his late portraits, though the calculated precision remains. Despite assimilating Italian techniques and Reformation theology, Holbein's art in many ways extended the Gothic tradition. His portrait style, for example, remained distinct from the more sensuous technique of  Titian , and from the  Mannerism  of  William Scrots , Holbein's successor as King's Painter. Holbein's portraiture, particularly his drawings, had more in common with that of  Jean Clouet , which he may have seen during his visit to France in 1524. He adopted Clouet's method of drawing with coloured chalks on a plain ground, as well as his care over preliminary portraits for their own sake. During his second stay in England, Holbein learned the technique of  limning , as practised by  Lucas Horenbout . In his last years, he raised the art of the  portrait miniature  to its first peak of brilliance."}

The album received much more attention in the indie-rock community than the debut. While the previous record had featured different musical styles for each song, You're Living All Over Me found the band's various disparate influences merging into each individual song. Although the hardcore punk influences were noticeably more muted than on Dinosaur, the overall sound was much more powerful, with the instruments often recorded very loud and with considerable distortion. While Mascis's guitar, alternating between Black Sabbath-like riffs, squalling solos, dissonant noise-rock and occasional quiet passages, was the main attraction, Barlow's bass, melodic, highly distorted and often playing thick two-note chords, competed for attention. Meanwhile, Murph played the Mascis-composed drum parts in a very heavy and powerful fashion, resulting in a version of the  power trio  format.  Mascis did most of the lead singing, in a detached drawl that presented a contrast with the extreme music. The songs were highly melodic, albeit with odd song structures that avoided the typical verse-chorus-verse patterns of most rock and pop songs.  Barlow also composed two songs:  the hardcore-influenced \"Lose\" and an acoustic sonic collage entitled \"Poledo\" that anticipated his work with  Sebadoh .", "neg_passage": "Hi Records  released the song as a single in June 1973, with \"I'm Glad You're Mine\" on the B-side.

In Unger\u2019s analysis, classical economics focused on the causal relations among social activities, which were connected with the production and distribution of wealth. Classical economists asked questions about the true basis of value, activities that contributed to national wealth, systems of rights, or about the forms of government under which people grow rich. In the late-nineteenth century, in response to attacks from socialist ideas and debates about how society works, and as a means to escape the conundrums of value theory and to answer how values could become prices,  marginalist economics  arose. This movement in economics disengaged economics from prescriptive and normative commitments to withdraw the study of economies from debates about how society worked and what kind of society we wanted to live in.

O'Neill was actually diagnosed with tuberculosis, the disease we are dealing with heavily in the play, so these seemingly irrelevant details were what really created the reality of the play for O\u2019Neill. O'Neill tells Mr. Tyler, \"It is a play of the significance of human hope and the T.B. background of the action is as important as the action itself in bringing out my meaning. Secondly: There are only about three coughs in the whole play and not one spit. A careful reading of the script will show you this statement Is true. Thirdly: As I took great care to impress upon Mr. Westley, I regard weighing the scene as one of the very best, technically and artistically, that I have ever written and, outside of a few cuts in the dialogue which may prove necessary, I will not consent to change it.\" He goes on to tell Mr. Tyler that he believes he isn\u2019t thinking of his play when directing it, but some other play he has created. O'Neill's ends his letter to Mr. Tyler with, \"I have no hope that it would be produced elsewhere in any immediate future; but I do know that I can get it published in book form, and I would rather have it judged that way than have my whole meaning misinterpreted\u2026\u2026..You sincerely think one way this play. I just as sincerely believe another, and that you are absolutely wrong, root and branch.\"  It is clear that Mr. O'Neill feels passionately about his plays and wants to make sure that they are depicted precisely how he feels they should be, but there have been few to explore this idea. Although there are resources dealing with The Straw are scarce, in Eugene O'Neill: A Life in Four Acts by Dowling it is revealed that Eileen Carmody, the female lead in The Straw, was actually based on a fellow Irish American patient that O\u2019Neill met during his own time spent in the sanatorium, Catherine Mackay. On page 99 in Eugene O'Neill: A Life in Four Acts it says, \"O\u2019Neill's portrayal of Eileen in his stage directions faithfully describes the actual Mackay: \"Her wavy mass of dark hair is parted in the middle and combed low on her forehead, covering her ears, to a knot at the back of her head. The oval of her face is spoiled by a long, rather heavy, Irish jaw contrasting with the delicacy of her other features,\" and her shape is \"slight and undeveloped\" (CPI, 729 as cited in Dowling, 2014, p. 99) This can lead us readers to assume that The Straw was constructed in a biographical type of way, thus helping understand O'Neill's desires to maintain his stage directions. Just like Stephen Murray in The Straw, O'Neill also spent a brief time in the sanatorium while suffering from tuberculosis and went through much of the same symptoms as Murray. It can also be noted, that O'Neill, before his professional play write career, wrote for the newspaper, just like Murray. To solidify the idea that O'Neill was in some ways creating a biographical context, I would like to draw attention to the closing that O'Neill used in a letter to one of his doctors from a sanatorium. Throughout the letter he shares health updates about himself and closes with, \"If, as they say, it is sweet to visit the place one was born in, then it will be doubly sweet for me to visit the place I was reborn in \u2013 for my second birth was the only one which had my full approval\".", "neg_passage": "O'Neill was born in  Sydney  in 1974. He began cycling in 1989, when he attended a 16 kilometre handicap race before school, following the suggestion by a friend. The race started at 6am and O'Neill won it. He went on to win numerous medals in the junior ranks at the  Australian National Track Championships . At the Junior  UCI Track Cycling World Championships  in 1992, O'Neill won the bronze medal as part of the team pursuit squad. In 1995, he won the silver medal in the road time trial at the Oceania Cycling Championships whilst nursing a broken pelvis. He was an  Australian Institute of Sport  scholarship holder."}

In the meantime, trials of the vaccine based on Sabin's version were carried out in the Soviet Union with important contributions made by  Mikhail Chumakov . In 1958, the Soviet Union organized industrial production of this vaccine and polio was largely eradicated in Eastern Europe and Japan. This success led to trials in the United States as well and the licensing of the Sabin's vaccine in 1961, over the considerable opposition of the March of Dimes, which supported Salk's vaccine.

All filming inside the mall took place at night after the mall had closed, with filming often continuing until dawn. Filming in the mall began in October 1977, but had to be suspended when the mall's Christmas decorations were hung shortly after Thanksgiving. Filming resumed in January after the decorations were removed. It was during that break that much of the mall's exterior shots were filmed, as well as filming at other locations. In the film's storyline, the mall was used as a fortress to protect four human survivors from a world taken over by the  walking dead . The movie went on to become a huge hit worldwide. Fans travel far and wide, sometimes from other countries, just to have a chance to visit the location. Several pictures taken during the filming are on display in a room on the upper level near Macy's.

Resisting the hyped image of computing in education as a boon to instructional productivity,Chandler recognized the computer as a tool for learning, but he rejected a prevailing objectivism that considered data as information, and information as knowledge.  He held a constructivist view that data is translated into information by human beings, not computers, and humans negotiatethe meaning of information by means of dialog and discussion (Chandler, 1990a).  The computer, for Chandler, was not a  teaching machine ,  but a medium of expression for young learners.  His early adoption of computers in the classroom led to the publication of several authored and edited texts related to computing in education. He left the classroom in 1981 and set up an independent consultancy, notably serving as a design consultant for  Acornsoft  on the development of educational software for use by the BBC.In 1989, Chandler returned to academia, joining the Education department at  Aberystwyth University .

Krasnow created a strange mix full of \"phasing\" that, by most accounts (including Beefheart's), diminished the music's strength. This was released in October 1968 as  Strictly Personal  on Krasnow's  Blue Thumb  label. Stewart Mason in his Allmusic review of the album described it as a \"terrific album\" and a \"fascinating, underrated release\", \"every bit the equal of Safe as Milk and Trout Mask Replica.

He had been mainly a sculptor and medallist, but he began oil painting, especially portraiture in oils, in 1897; his early mentor was  John Singer Sargent . He exhibited works at the  Royal Academy of Arts  in 1898 and he taught there. He worked on commissions including portraits for  Queen Victoria  and  Edward VII , and his portraits became fashionable among various patrons from the  aristocracy  and  high society . He was honoured with the  Royal Victorian Order  (MVO) in 1909. While in England he was employed by the  Birmingham Mint . By 1905 he had been teaching at Paris, Berlin,  Munich , Vienna, and Rome and was making winter trips to the United States.", "neg_passage": "Alma also claims that Mahler described the three hammer-blows of the finale as 'three blows of fate, the last of which fells [the hero] as a tree is felled'. Deciding that the hero was Mahler himself, and that the symphony was 'prophetic', she then identified these three blows with three later events in her husband's life: his 'forced resignation' from the  Vienna State Opera ; the death of his eldest daughter; and the diagnosis of a fatal heart condition. In addition, she claims that Mahler eventually deleted the third hammer-blow from the score out of sheer superstition, in an (unsuccessful) attempt to stave off a third disaster in his own life. Again, the story has become canonic; but the difficulties it presents are several. First, Alma's programmatic interpretation is not corroborated by the composer or any other source. Second, Mahler's resignation from the Opera was not, in reality, 'forced', and was not necessarily even a 'disaster'. Third, Alma exaggerates the seriousness of her husband's 'heart condition', which was not inevitably fatal. Fourth, she neglects to mention that Mahler's discovery of her own infidelity was a 'blow' of far greater weight than at least one (and possibly two) of the other events she does mention. Fifth, her story once again falls foul of the known chronology: Mahler revised the symphony in the Summer of 1906 \u2014 whereas all three of the events reported by Alma took place after this time: Mahler requested release from his Vienna Opera contract in May 1907, and it was in July of that year that his daughter died and his heart condition was diagnosed. Sixth, her report of Mahler's 'superstitious' reason for removing the third hammer-blow not only has no corroboration of any kind, but also betrays an ignorance of the musical sources. Mahler originally notated no fewer than five large percussive impacts in the score of his finale (b.9, b.336, b.479, b.530, b.783); these five were later reduced to a 'classically' dramatic three and specifically allotted to a 'Hammer' \u2014 though with one of these blows (the last) occurring in a structural and gestural context that makes it very different from the other two (and equivalent to the two that were removed). It was this anomalous blow that Mahler, in revising the work, chose to delete \u2014 making the important question not 'Why did he finally take it out?', but 'Why did he first leave it in?'"}

The inclusion of 'decent hierarchical peoples' is demanded by the notion of toleration: a notion Rawls sees as integral to liberalism.  In part, the Law of Peoples is an attempt to show how far international toleration by liberal societies can reasonably be expected to extend.", "neg_passage": "One specific meaning of the term religious abuse refers to  psychological manipulation  and harm inflicted on a person by using the teachings of their religion.

Moreover, it also entertains ontological conceptions and theoretical discussions making it a research monograph and not a methodological handbook per se.", "neg_passage": "In her first book, Theorizing Modernism: Visual Art and the Critical Tradition (1994), Drucker maps  visual arts  discourses through a rigorous examination of the rhetoric of 19th and 20th century critical writing and art practice. In the process, she theorizes the modernist tradition of visual art through a rhetoric of representation rather than from a formalist or historical approach, particularly regarding  space , the ontology of the object, and the production of  subjectivity . In The Visible Word: Experimental Typography and Modern Art (1994), Drucker contends that much art criticism of  Futurism ,  Dada , and  Cubism  has failed to appreciate the fundamental materiality of these movements in relation to both visual and poetic forms of representation. Drucker emphasized, for the first time, the extent to which typographic activity furthered debates about the very nature and function of the  avant-garde . Continuing with her interest in letterform, Drucker's next book, The Alphabetic Labyrinth: The Letters in History and Imagination (1995) analyzes the history of the alphabet, not just as a collection of arbitrary signs, but as the direct visual embodiment of meaning in relation to intellectual movements. For example, she shows how modern typefaces, first developed in the late 18th century, embody Enlightenment philosophy. Shifting her focus to  artist books , Century of Artists' Books (1995) is the first full-length analysis of the development of artists' books as a 20th-century art form, exploring their structure, form, and conceptualization. Analyzing such artistic luminaries as  William Morris ,  Marcel Duchamp , and  Max Ernst , Drucker considers the book as metaphor, poem, and narrative or non-narrative sequence by situating its historical, theoretical, sociological, and technical aspects within 20th century avant-garde art movements. Figuring the Word: Essays on Books, Writing, and Visual Poetics (1998) is a collection of selected critical essays by Drucker previously published in literary and scholarly journals. The book begins with a discussion of her work as a  book artist  and an account of what led her to pursue her scholarly interests. She provides close readings of contemporary language artists and the use of language in cyberspace."}

Thornton's business prowess resulted in his plantation which he named  Thornhill  becoming one of the most successful in the region.

There is strong evidence to indicate that both buildings were designed by the Alabama architect  William Nichols , who served as State Architect during Thornton's tenure in government.

The bison would frequently move across tribal boundaries, and desperate hunters would be tempted to follow, leading to frequent disputes. The bison declined sooner in the  parkland belt  where the Cree lived then on the  shortgrass prairie s to the south.  The Cree blamed the HBC and M\u00e9tis for this, but still needed them for trade. Bison could still be found on Blackfoot territories, forcing Cree hunting bands to stray into Blackfoot territory, leading to conflict. During these buffalo wars, alliances shifted once again, however the Iron Confederacy was never able to regain (permanent) access to the bison herds.", "neg_passage": "The  American bison  (Bison bison) once numbered in the millions, perhaps between 25 million and 60 million by some estimates, and they were possibly the most numerous large land animal on earth.

The Wind Cave bison herd was started with 14 bison from the  New York Zoological Society  and with six animals transplanted from the Yellowstone Park bison herd.  In addition, in the 1960s, one single bull bison was received from  Theodore Roosevelt National Park .  The Yellowstone Park bison herd was the last free-ranging bison herd in the United States and the only place where they did not go locally extinct, so they have become at least part of the foundation stock for many other herds, including the Wind Cave bison herd.

Alma herself is drawn to him, with Genevieve Aristide describing Becket as a \"beacon\" for her (an entry in a computer log establishes Becket's 100-percent compatibility score). An Armacham researcher going by the moniker \"Snake Fist\" theorizes that Alma is drawn to Becket by a desire to kill and \"absorb\" him.  When Alma initially makes contact with Becket in the school, she pulls back and regards him with interest; then she manifests in her third form, a naked, shapely young woman (reflecting her newfound desire towards Becket). During the course of the game, Alma attacks the other candidates for Project Harbinger, killing two of them. She also psychically attacks Harold Keegan, enthralling him and causing him to wander into the abandoned Still Island nuclear power plant. She attacks Becket himself physically, often assaulting and grappling with him, which he constantly fends off. Other times, she pulls Becket into hallucinations, often centering on a grassy hill and a single tree, from which Alma plays with a swing set that can be found on the Still Island reactor. Ultimately, when Becket is poised to be killed by Alma, she instead spares his life, having clearly developed feelings for him. Becket and squadmate Keira Stokes attempt to use a telesthetic amplifier to amplify Becket's own psychic abilities to defeat Alma, but before they can try, Genevieve Aristide kills Stokes and sabotages the plan, intending to seal Alma away with Becket and use her as leverage. Alma arrives before Aristide seals the device, and turns her attention on Becket, allowing Aristide to seal them both away. Alma establishes a psychic bond with Becket, and sends his mind into a hallucination where he fights off distorted images of Keegan while trying to activate the chamber within the hallucination; all the while Alma is  raping  Becket in the real world. At the end of the battle, Becket is apparently still sealed within the device. The door to the chamber then opens, revealing a destroyed landscape indicating that Becket is seeing things from Alma's point of view.

Studies shows that Chinese women experienced rapid progress in terms of gender equality during the Cultural Revolution. When the People's Republic of China was established, employed women accounted for only 7 percent of the workforce; whereas in 1992 women's participation in the workforce had increased to account for 38 percent.Women's representation in higher educational institutions has also increased since the establishment of the People's Republic of China. Under the traditional  Chinese patriarchy  structure, the society was male-dominated, and women in  Hong Kong  had a relatively subordinate familial role. However, there is a cultural change  in Hong Kong during the  British colonial period  with an emergence of Western culture (i.e. \" Westernization \"). A mix of traditional Chinese culture and Western values creates a unique  culture of Hong Kong . Along with the rapid economic and social development of Hong Kong since the end of the  Second World War , a significant improvement in the role of men has been witnessed, while female dominance society structure is still taking in place. Hence, women studies in Hong Kong are slightly differ from  China 's. Women in Hong Kong are generally more independent, monetarily autonomous, assertive, and career-focused; which makes them seem to be more prominent when comparing with women in some other  Southeast Asian countries . With the increase number of women in professional and managerial positions in recent decades, the terms of \"female strong person\" or \" superwomen \" are being used to describe women in Hong Kong. Candice Chio Ngan Ieng, president of the  Macau Women's General Association  (AGMM), describes in 2010 that women are currently defining themselves as capable and irreplaceable powers to  Macau's  modern-day civilization.

Kent extended that lead on the Monday morning to 191 and Yorkshire, faced with a sticky wicket after heavy overnight rain, were not expected to win.

Sutcliffe scored so slowly at times that some of his own supporters began to complain but Sutcliffe silenced them, after finally taking a single, by holding out his bat and inviting them to come and do better.  It was humorously done and the crowd laughed.

In the second Test, Hutton scored 72 and 77 but could not prevent another defeat after losing his seventh consecutive toss in Tests. England batted slowly throughout; Hutton was himself barracked for his slow, defensive batting during the match. England won the third Test by nine wickets, their first victory in the Caribbean since 1935. Hutton, who finally won the toss, scored 169 in seven hours and West Indies were bowled out twice. After a drawn fourth Test, England had to win the final Test to draw the series. Hutton lost the toss but his bowlers dismissed West Indies cheaply in good batting conditions. Hutton then batted for almost nine hours to score 205, his nineteenth and final Test century. Wisden observed that \"For concentration and control, Hutton's innings ... scarcely could have been excelled.\" The innings ended amid another controversy when local officials and journalists accused Hutton of snubbing the congratulations of the Chief Minister  Alexander Bustamante  during a tea interval. Hutton apologised, not having noticed Bustamante speaking to him, but was dismissed immediately when play resumed; the incident was prominently reported the following day. England's bowlers bowled out West Indies a second time and England scored the required runs to record a series-levelling victory, West Indies' first defeat in Jamaica in a Test. In its summary of the tour, Wisden said that Hutton showed mastery over every bowler. The correspondent wrote, \"From first to last no batsman compared with Hutton ... Considering the weight of his many responsibilities and worries, Hutton played magnificent cricket\". The press were generally supportive despite reservations over his caution.

In 1916\u201318, Faisal headed the Northern Army of the rebellion that confronted the Ottomans in what was to later become western Saudi Arabia, Jordan and Syria. In 1917, Faisal, desiring an empire for himself instead of conquering one for his father, attempted to negotiate an arrangement with the Ottomans under which he would rule the Ottoman vilayets of Syria and Mosul as an Ottoman vassal. In December 1917 Faisal contacted General  Djemal Pasha  declaring his willingness to defect to the Ottoman side provided they would give him an empire to rule, saying the Skyes-Picot agreement had disillusioned him in the Allies and he now wanted to work with his fellow Muslims. Only the unwillingness of the Three Pashas to subcontract ruling part of the Ottoman Empire to Faisal kept him loyal to his father when it finally dawned on him that the Ottomans were just trying to divide and conquer the Hashemite forces. In his book The Seven Pillars of Wisdom, Lawrence sought to put the best gloss on Faisal's double-dealing as it would contradict the image he was seeking to promote of Faisal as a faithful friend of the Allies betrayed by the British and the French, claiming that Faisal was only seeking to divide the \"nationalist\" and \"Islamist\" factions in the ruling  Committee of Union and Progress  (CUP). The Israeli historians Major Effraim Karsh and his wife Inari wrote that the veracity of Lawrence's account is open to question given that the major dispute within the CUP was not between the Islamist Djemal Pasha and the nationalist Mustafa Kemal as claimed by Lawrence, but rather between Enver Pasha vs. Djemal Pasha. In the spring of 1918 after Germany launched Operation Michael on 21 March 1918, which appeared for a time to foreordain the defeat of the Allies, Faisal again contacted Djemal Pasha asking for peace provided that he be allowed to rule Syria as an Ottoman vassal, which Djemal confident of victory declined to consider.  After a  30-month-long siege  he conquered  Medina , defeating the defense organized by  Fakhri Pasha  and looting the city. Emir Faisal also worked with the  Allies  during World War I in their conquest of  Greater Syria  and the capture of  Damascus  in October 1918.

He labeled the new policy \"as an acceptable risk for peace.\" The plan was compared to Nixon's, which the candidate stated would not be revealed until  Inauguration Day . After the speech, anti-war protesters stopped shadowing Humphrey's appearances, and a few McCarthy supporters joined the campaign. Donations totaling $300,000 were immediately made to Humphrey, and he also improved in the polls, cutting Nixon's lead to single digits by mid-October. Meanwhile, Nixon tried to shift the emphasis of the campaign to the issue of  law and order , and declared that a vote for Humphrey, would amount to \"a vote to continue a lackadaisical, do nothing attitude toward the crime crisis in America.\" While campaigning in  San Antonio , Humphrey went on the attack against Nixon. He accused the Republican nominee of playing politics with human rights, and claimed that he was \"on the road to defeat.\" Hoping to gain favor among the  Hispanic  community, Humphrey alleged that Nixon had never discussed the concerns of Hispanic-Americans during the course of the campaign. Nixon continued to tie Humphrey to Johnson. He argued that the administration was playing politics with the Vietnam War by trying to complete a treaty before the election to favor the Vice President. Humphrey fired back at Nixon's allegations, stating that the former Vice President was using \"the old Nixon tactic of unsubstantiated insinuation\" and requested that he show evidence for his claims. Humphrey challenged Nixon to a series of presidential debates, but the Republican nominee declined, largely due to his uncomfortable experience at the 1960 presidential debates, and to deny recognition to the populist  American Independent Party  candidate, Governor  George Wallace  of Alabama, who would have been included at the event. Both the Humphrey and Nixon campaigns were concerned that Wallace would take a sizable amount of states in the electoral college and force the House of Representatives to decide the election. Although Wallace had focused most of his campaign on the south, he was drawing large crowds during appearances in the north.

Winter observed that O'Neal influenced the entire team against Bryant. Winter thought that Bryant made it a point to get the ball to O'Neal that year, but O'Neal did not appreciate what Bryant was doing to help him. During  that season's All-Star Game , Bryant did not participate in the  Slam Dunk Contest  and a matchup against  Vince Carter , following Jackson's request to pass on individual accomplishments to keep the focus on the team. During All-Star warm-ups, O'Neal mimicked Bryant's  crossover dribble  but threw the ball into the stands to accentuate Bryant's turnovers. O'Neal said it was an  inside joke  between Kobe and him. Jackson and Winter relied on the  triangle offense  to heal the relationship between O'Neal and Bryant. The coaches believed that the offense was so structured that the relationship between the two players would be smoother on the court. The coaches would also tell the team they did not see the selfishness in Bryant that the players saw.

During recording sessions in 1997 original PJ Harvey Trio drummer Rob Ellis rejoined Harvey's band, and Flood was hired again as producer. The sessions, which continued into April the following year, resulted in  Is This Desire?  (1998).

Although these songs do directly consider longing and loss, many of the songs on To Bring You My Love focus particularly on these topics, specifically considering the loss of, or longing for, a departed lover. The title track presents a narrator who not only desires love but is willing to sacrifice everything to get it. \"I\u2019ve lain with the devil,\" Harvey sings, \"Cursed God above/Forsaken Heaven/To bring you my love.\""}

Observations of current religious beliefs and practices demonstrate that Sinhalese as a religious community have complex worldview as Buddhists. Due to the proximity and on some occasions similarity of certain doctrines, there are many areas where Buddhists and Hindus share religious views and practices. This can lead to the opinion that Buddhists have adopted religious elements from Hindu traditions in their religious practices.

The Norse-Gaels had intermarried with speakers of  Irish , a language also spoken at the time in Scotland (being the ancestor of  Scottish Gaelic ). Evidence of a mixed cultural background in later settlers may be found in the Norse-Irish ring pins found in the Faroe Islands, and in features of Faroese vocabulary. Examples of such words (derived from Middle Irish) are: \"blak/bla\u00f0ak\" ( buttermilk ),  Irish  bl\u00e1thach; \"drunnur\" (animal tail),  Irish  dronn (chine);  \"gr\u00fakur\" ( head ),  Irish  gruaig (hair); \"l\u00e1mur\" (hand, paw),  Irish  l\u00e1mh (hand); \"tarvur\" ( bull ),  Irish  tarbh; and \"\u00e6rgi\" ( pasture  in the outfield),  Irish  \u00e1irge (byre, milking place: Mod. Irish \u00e1ir\u00ed). The discovery at Toftanes on Eysteroy of wooden devotional crosses apparently modelled on Irish or Scottish exemplars would indicate that some of the settlers were Christian. It has also been suggested that the typical curvilinear stone-built walls enclosing early ecclesiastical sites in the Faroes (as in Norse settlements elsewhere) reflect a Celtic Christian style, seen in the circular enclosures of early ecclesiastical sites in Ireland. Indirect support for this theory has been found in genetic research showing that many Norse settler women in the Faroe Islands had Celtic forebears.", "neg_passage": "Ireland.
